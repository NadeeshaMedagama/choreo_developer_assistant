A comprehensive solution to process architecture diagrams, extract text,
generate summaries, create embeddings, and maintain knowledge graphs.

- Single Responsibility: Each class has one clear purpose
- Open/Closed: Extensible for new file types
- Liskov Substitution: Interface-based design
- Interface Segregation: Focused interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions
